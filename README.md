# Solid Monty

This is a project to describe a language called _Solid Monty_ used to make CAD scripts. The programming style is functional and
based on [constructive solid geometry](wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry). This repository is only about the language
itself and not about implementations. At this moment there is only one implementation based on FreeCAD.
  
For more information read the [documentation](documentation.md).

## SolidMonty Builders

In order to run SolidMonthy scripts you will need to install a builder (this is, an implemantation of the Solid Monty language).
