# Monty's CAD

This is a project to describe a language called _Monty's CAD_ used to make CAD scripts. The programming style is functional and
based on [constructive solid geometry](wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry). This repository is only about the language
itself and not about implementations. At this moment there is only one implementation based on FreeCAD. 


## Monty's CAD Builders

In order to run Monthy's CAD scripts you will need to intall a builder (this is, an implemantation of Monty's CAD language).
